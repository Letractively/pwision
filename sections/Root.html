In PWision we are in the object-oriented world: ``in traditional structured programming, when a software tool is not doing what the application needs, we modify the source code of the tool until it works. The process of amending the source code is a risky step as long as the programmer does not know in detail the source code; more than that, changing the source may entail the introduction of programming errors that can dictate unforeseen behavior of the program. In <i>[PWision]</i>, we will never change the source code: we will change <i>[PWision]</i> by extending it''.
